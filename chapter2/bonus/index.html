        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em> is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) set in the expansive Star Wars universe.<br> 
        Developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts, the game was first released in December 2011. Set thousands of years before the events of the movies, during the era of the Old Republic, SWTOR explores the battles between the Jedi and the Sith as they struggle for dominance in a galaxy torn apart by war.<br>
        SWTOR stands out as one of the most ambitious Star Wars-based games, combining elements of the beloved franchise with the role-playing depth of BioWareâ€™s earlier titles, such as Mass Effect and Dragon Age. It offers both single-player and multiplayer experiences, allowing players to immerse themselves in a rich narrative-driven universe where their choices have significant consequences.</p>

        <h2>Setting and Story</h2>
        <p>SWTOR is set roughly 300 years after the events of the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) series, but it still takes place many millennia before the events of the Star Wars films.<br>
        This period is defined by the ongoing war between two major factions: the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.</p>

        <h2>The Galactic Republic</h2>
        <p>The Republic, a democratic and united federation of planets, stands in stark contrast to the Sith Empire.<br> 
        Its guardians, the Jedi Order, have dedicated their lives to the light side of the Force, protecting the galaxy from threats and upholding peace and justice. 
        However, the Republic is in a weakened state after centuries of conflict, making it vulnerable to the ever-growing power of the Sith Empire.</p>

        <h2>The Sith Empire</h2>
        <p>The Sith Empire, ruled by the Sith Emperor, is a militaristic empire founded on the teachings of the dark side of the Force.<br> 
        The Sith are notorious for their manipulation, cruelty, and thirst for domination, and they are in an ongoing struggle with the Republic for control of the galaxy.<br>
        While the Sith are adept at wielding the dark side of the Force, their internal power struggles and betrayals often lead to instability.</p>

        <h2>Free-to-Play and Subscription Model</h2>
        <p>SWTOR offers a free-to-play model with the option of upgrading to a subscription.<br>
        The free-to-play model gives players access to a wide array of content, but certain features like additional character slots, certain story content, and faster progression are restricted unless you opt for a subscription.<br>
        Subscription players enjoy additional perks such as early access to expansions, more character customization options, and premium currency.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><strong>Star Wars: The Old Republic</strong> combines the grandeur of the Star Wars universe with rich, character-driven storytelling, action-packed combat, and immersive world-building.<br>
        Whether you're interested in following the heroic path of the Jedi, delving into the dark arts of the Sith, or playing as a rogue smuggler or bounty hunter, SWTOR offers an experience tailored to both casual players and hardcore MMORPG fans.<br>
        With expansive updates, expansions, and a rich community of players, SWTOR continues to thrive in the Star Wars universe as a unique and memorable entry in the MMO genre.</p>
