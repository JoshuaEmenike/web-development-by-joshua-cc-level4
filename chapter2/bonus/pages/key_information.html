        <h2>Key Information</h2>
        <p><em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em> is an MMORPG developed by BioWare. It was released in 2011 and has received numerous expansions over the years.<br>
        Players can choose from multiple character classes, each with unique storylines and abilities.<br>
        SWTOR takes place thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, during the era of the Old Republic.<br>
        The galaxy is divided between two major factions: the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.<br>
        A fragile peace exists between the two, but tensions are high, leading to a constant threat of war.<br>
        The Sith Emperor, once thought dead, returns with plans to dominate the galaxy using the dark side of the Force.<br>
        Players can align with either the Republic or the Empire, with each faction having different playable classes (Jedi, Sith, Troopers, Imperial Agents, etc.).<br>
        Personal journeys are a key focus, with choices that affect the playerâ€™s character and the galaxy's future.<br>
        The Republic, though noble, is weakened by corruption and struggles to fight back the Sith threat.<br>
        The Sith Empire seeks to conquer the galaxy, using the dark side of the Force and ancient Sith rituals to gain power.<br>
        The plot explores themes of light vs. dark, with players deciding whether to follow the light side or embrace the dark side of the Force.<br>
        Ultimately, the game revolves around the battle against the Sith Emperor and the fate of the galaxy, shaped by player choices.<br>
        This provides a concise overview of the central plot and main conflict of SWTOR.</p>
