		<p>From the moment you first log in, Star Wars: The Old Republic puts you in the mindset of a star-hopping badass.<br> The opening cinematic, where the Sith appear out of nowhere and reclaim Korriban, introduces you to the conflict between the Empire and the Republic, whichwas kinda cool .<br> Then you choose which faction you're going to play for, and another cinematic sets the tone of your alignmentwhich allows players more freedom to choose<br>. For Empire players, the focus is on power, control, and anger. The Republic cinematic portrays a need to take back what's lost through planning and tenacity this makes thee game very intersting .<br>  The cinematics are spectacularly compelling and make me wish Blur, the creators, were contracted to do a feature-length film.<br>
you are allowed to create your character in the main screen, also the creator is quite flexible, with a wide range of customization options unique to each race, but you're limited only to strictly humanoid races and a few rather similar body sizes (males at least get a "fat" option â€“ female characters don't even get that).<br> For a universe with a vast number of established intelligent races of all shapes and sizes, this feels limited. You can't, for example, play as a Jawa or a droid. In the grand scheme of things, it's a minor annoyance though.</p>
